    "\n",
    "**Input**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The graph data\n",
    "* A sequence of superheroes h = [h_2, ..., h_n-1]\n",
    "* Initial node h_1 and an end node h_n\n",
    "* N: denoting the top N heroes that their data should be considered\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The shortest walk of comics that you need to read to get from hero_1 to hero_n\n",
    "\n",
    "Considerations: For this functionality, you need to implement an algorithm that returns the shortest walk that goes from node h_j to h_n, which visits in order the nodes in h. The choice of h_j and h_n can be made randomly (or if it improves the performance of the algorithm, you can also define it in any other way)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Notes**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* This algorithm should be run only on the second graph.\n",
    "* The algorithm needs to handle the case that the graph is not connected. Thus, only some of the nodes in h are reachable from h_1. In such a scenario, it is enough to let the program give in the output the string \"There is no such path\".\n",
    "* Since we are dealing with walks, you can pass on the same node h_i more than once, but you have to preserve order. E.g., if you start from Spiderman to reach deadpool, and your path requires you to visit iron-man and colossus, you can go back to any comics any time you want, assuming that the order in which you visit the heroes is still the same.\n"
