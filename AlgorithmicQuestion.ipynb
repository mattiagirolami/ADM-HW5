    "## 6. Algorithmic Question\n",
    "\n",
    "Alex and Sarah have been together for two years, and Alex is now thinking about proposing to her. But, to surprise her, he wants to install an app on her phone that asks her if she will marry him at the right time.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, to install the application secretly, he needs her phone's password, which he does not have. He knows her password is a poly-line made up of vertical or horizontal line segments. In a 3*3 grid, each line segment connects the centres of two cells. Alex learned the direction of each line segment by looking at her hand while unlocking her phone. He didn't pay much attention to the length of each line segment, but he is sure that her phone's operating system does not allow the poly-line to intersect with itself even at one point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alex wants to distract Sarah's attention long enough to test all possible patterns based on the directions of the line segments he has learned. Therefore, he needs you to assist him in calculating how many possible patterns he has to try based on those directions to estimate how much time he needs to check all of those possibilities. Given that the line segments were directed right, down, left, and up, the following figure depicts two valid and one invalid (as the poly-lines should not intersect even in one point) patterns."
